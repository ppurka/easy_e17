easy_e17 is not functional any more because of the move of e from svn to
git. An updated version of these patches is present in
http://github.com/ppurka/easy_efl


easy_e17:

This is a script to compile and install the Enlightenment Foundation
Libraries and Enlightenment-DR17. The script is originally written by
morlenxus ( http://omicron.homeip.net ).

This version is the patched version of the script.
Patched by P. Purkayastha (ppurka @ #e). Licensing terms are same as
original script (BSD License).

The patched version of the script has several modifications:
 1. The build system has been changed. The script now compiles files in
    a temporary directory instead of the source files directory. The
    rationale for doing so is to make sure that the build directory is
    always clean.
 2. The script keeps track of all the installed files by writing log files
    in `$HOME/.config/easy_e17`. The next time a package is updated, the
    script will remove the already installed files and then install the new
    files. This ensures that stale files do not remain installed.
    The unpatched version of the script can do this if you pass `--clean
    --clean --clean` (yes, three times) to it. The problem here is that it
    has to uninstall _before_ the compilation of the updated version. So,
    if the compilation fails, then you are left with no installed package.
 3. You can provide user patches to the packages by making sure that the
    patches work with level -p1. For instance if you want to patch e then
    the following should work:
    ```cd e
    patch -p1 -i e.patch```
    This file e.patch should be present in `$HOME/.config/easy_e17`
    directory. The patch should be always named as <package_name>.patch.
    The package_name is the same name as the svn directory name (e.patch
    for e, eina.patch for eina, etc).
 4. The script can backup your current installation if you provide the -b
    or --backup option.
